Programs (and, by the Curry-Howard correspondence, proofs) are rich
inductive structures. This fact is well understood amongst researchers and
experienced programmers, but still somewhat obscure amongst programmers at
large because programmers normally construct and interact with programs
only indirectly, e.g. using a text editor composed with a parser.

There are some benefits to this approach, to be sure, but the structural
mismatch between programs and their textual representations also imposes
various burdens.  For example, the primitive edit actions available in a
text editor (e.g. inserting or deleting a character or word) do not always
correspond to sensible structural transformations.
