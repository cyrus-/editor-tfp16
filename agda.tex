Our work includes a formalization of the grammar and judgements given above
in the proof assistant Agda. We refer readers unfamiliar with the
particulars of Agda to the Wiki, hosted
at \url{http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/}.

This formalization is a work in progress at the time of submission. The
goal is fully mechanized proofs Theorem \ref{thrm:actsafe} and
Theorem \ref{thrm:actdet} that act as a platform to explore future
metatheory. The development can be found at
\url{http://github.com/ivoysey/agda-tfp16}, which includes the actual Agda
source as well as a more detailed discussion of the various representation
decisions and assumptions made.

The core idea of our formalization is to encode each judgement as a
dependent type. The rules of the judgements become the constructors of the
type, and derivations of theorems values of the type. This is a rich
setting that allows proofs to take advantage of pattern matching on the
shape of derivations, closely matching on-paper proofs of similar
properties.


TODO: something to cite for agda in general? this particular technique?
it's pretty standard as far as i understand; i'm not sure where i learned
it.
