Part of our work is a formalization of the grammar and judgements given
above in Agda. The goal of this work is fully mechanized proofs Theorem
\ref{thrm:actsafe} and Theorem \ref{thrm:actdet} as well as a platform to
explore future work. This development can be found at
\url{http://github.com/ivoysey/agda-tfp16}. This includes the actual Agda
source, as well as a more detailed discussion of the representation
decisions and assumptions made.

The core idea of the formalization is to encode each judgement as a
dependent type. The rules of the judgements become the constructors of the
type, and derivations of theorems values of the type. This is a rich
setting
