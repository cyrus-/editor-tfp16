Our work includes a formalization of the grammar and judgements given above
in the proof assistant Agda. The goal is fully mechanized proofs
Theorem \ref{thrm:actsafe} and Theorem \ref{thrm:actdet} as well as a
platform to explore future work. The development can be found at
\url{http://github.com/ivoysey/agda-tfp16}, which includes the actual Agda
source as well as a more detailed discussion of the various representation
decisions and assumptions made.

The core idea of the formalization is to encode each judgement as a
dependent type. The rules of the judgements become the constructors of the
type, and derivations of theorems values of the type. This is a rich
setting that allows proofs to take advantage of pattern matching on the
shape of derivations, closely matching on-paper proofs of similar
properties.
